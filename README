🏥 Agentic Hospital AI
Balancing Risk and Capacity in Hospital Care
🚀 Problem Statement

Hospitals struggle to manage patient flow and care escalation in real time because:

Patient conditions change continuously

Beds, staff, and resources are limited

Decisions rely on static rules and manual coordination

This results in:

Overcrowded emergency rooms

Delayed or premature escalation

Inefficient use of critical resources

Core problem:
There is no intelligent system that can continuously observe, reason, and adapt decisions as hospital conditions evolve.

💡 Our Solution

We built an Agentic AI system for hospitals that:

Uses LLMs + rule-based intelligence

Continuously reasons about:

Patient risk

Resource availability

Staff workload

WHO safety thresholds

Supports dynamic decisions instead of static dashboards

This system acts like a digital care coordinator, supporting doctors, nurses, and administrators in real time.

🧠 What is “Agentic AI” here?

Our system is agentic, not just predictive, because it:

Observes evolving patient data

Reasons about multiple constraints

Takes actions (recommendations, escalations, scheduling)

Revisits decisions as conditions change

Each responsibility is handled by a specialized agent.

🤖 Agents Implemented
1️⃣ Diagnostic Agent

Accepts patient reports (text or files)

Uses LLMs to summarize and extract risk signals

Assists doctors (does NOT replace diagnosis)

2️⃣ Risk Assessment Agent

Computes a dynamic risk score (0–100)

Uses vitals, symptoms, and WHO thresholds

Categorizes patients into:

High Risk (≥70) → frequent monitoring

Medium Risk (40–70) → moderate monitoring

Low Risk (<40) → routine observation

3️⃣ Decision Agent

Determines care path:

Immediate escalation

Observation

Routine care

Balances safety with hospital capacity

4️⃣ Recommendation Agent

Assigns:

Department (Cardiology, ER, Surgery, etc.)

Doctor

Required resources (ICU, ECG, OT, etc.)

Based on patient condition + hospital state

5️⃣ Doctor Agent

Reviews AI insights

Approves:

Surgical vs non-surgical path

Nurse instructions

Retains full human control

6️⃣ Nurse Coordination Agent

Receives doctor-approved instructions

Guides vitals monitoring intervals

Prepares resources when required

7️⃣ Predictive Deterioration Agent

Uses vitals trends to predict:

Improvement

Stability

Deterioration

Alerts doctors early

8️⃣ Stability & Discharge Agent

Tracks vitals stability over doctor-defined time

Decides:

Discharge

Retest

Continued observation

Automates post-discharge workflow

9️⃣ Admin & Capacity Agent

Tracks:

Beds

ICU capacity

Nurse load

Resources

Displays real-time hospital state

Supports operational decisions

🔟 WHO Integration Agent

Fetches WHO thresholds (free public data)

Dynamically adjusts risk evaluation

Keeps system aligned with global safety standards
